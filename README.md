# VR-Practical-Training-Centre
Represented university to implement a Virtual Reality project of Practical Training Centre based on HTC Vive to allow students to experiment and train with virtual equipment.

The system is partly a simulation of the environment. Through the simulation of the building, VR equipment users will feel a fully immersive tour experience. The other part is a display system, through text images, interactive UI, 3D models and other elements to achieve the laboratory introduction, project demonstration, etc.
The project aims to provide an immersive tour experience, an interactive solid UI system and other features under VR environment simulation. Then implant a guidance system to fully immerse the user in the intense experience and interaction brought by the VR environment.

# Features
**Model** All models are fully restored to real scenes, made in 3DMAX, Maya.

**Immersive Presentation** The multimedia objects such as text, pictures and 3D models provide a platform for the presentation of laboratory projects, which are convenient, intuitive and more infectious with the help of VR features.

**Gesture Recognition**Through the waving of the handle, determines what event the user has triggered based on the path of movement of the handle or rather the pattern drawn, inspired by the game anime where the wizard sends out different spells through different hand gestures.

**Voice Recognition** Use ifly voice recognition platform to monitor users' voice input and perform operations.

**Simulation experiments**In the simulation scene, a series of mechanical experiments, Newton's law tests, perpetual motion machines, etc. can be simulated. 
Firstly, in VR scenes, it is possible to achieve effects such as frictionless forces that cannot be achieved in real life. 
Second, avoid the constraints of time and space for the experiment, with the means of simulation, to solve the reality, by the instruments and other factors can not achieve the experimental activities. 
Third, ensure safety. Faulty experimental operation will not cause any harm to the user or the environment. The experimental components can be repeatly used without consumption. It also can simulate electrical electromagnetism experiments affected by factors such as resistance and magnetic fields.

In the centre of the hall there will be a three-dimensional map that can be zoomed in and out.
